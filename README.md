# Text-Categorization
A)	Implementation of text classification algorithm using Naive Bayes.
B)	Training the classifier on a labelled dataset and evaluating its performance.


Text classification is a type of machine learning that categorizes text documents or sentences into predefined classes or categories. 
It analyzes the content and meaning of the text and then uses text labeling to assign it the most appropriate label.
A text classifier can take this phrase as an input, analyze its content, and then automatically assign relevant tags, such as UI and Easy To Use.

How Does Text Classification Work?
You can perform text classification in two ways: manual or automatic.
Manual text classification involves a human annotator, who interprets the content of text and categorizes it accordingly. This method can deliver good results but itâ€™s time-consuming and expensive.

Automatic text classification applies machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), and other AI-guided techniques to automatically classify text in a faster, more cost-effective, and more accurate manner.
